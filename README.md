Favorite Movie Selector is a program that gives you different movie genres to choose from and based on what the genre you choose it gives you a movie recommendation. I learned how to use if and else statements and for i in range loops.

Quote Translator is a program that has a prewritten text and gives you options to translate it to the given language options. This code expanded my understanding of flet where I learned how to use radio buttons.
